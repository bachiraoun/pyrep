"""
PYthon REPository or pyrep package provides a pythonic way to organize dumping and pulling
python objects and other type of files to a folder or a directory that is called
repository. A Repository can be created in any directory or folder, it suffices to
initialize a Repository instance in a directory to start dumping and pulling objects into
it. Any directory or a folder that contains a .pyrepinfo binary file in it, is
theoretically a pyrep Repository. By default dump and pull methods use pickle to
serialize storing python objects. Practically any other method can be used simply by
providing the means and the required libraries in a simple form of string.
